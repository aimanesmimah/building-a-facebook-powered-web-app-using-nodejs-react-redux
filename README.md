Backend 
-----
the backend is a nodejs express rest api that runs on : http://localhost:7000

* npm start : to start the backend 

Frontend
-----
the frontend is a react web app created using the facebook tool create-react-app 

the app is still in the development mode and runs on : http://localhost:3000 

To redirect the http asynchronous requests from the react app to the server we added a proxy address in the package.json file

* npm install : to install all packages
* npm start : to start the app on the host server
 
 
database 
-----
The app implements the api of monogodb database and mongoose to persist user model data

make sure that you have mongodb installed as well as configured in accordance with the configuration of the user model in the app 
before running the server

facebook test 
-----
the facebook app is still working in the development mode

so if you want to connect your own facebook account for testing you should provide me with your user account so that
I add you as a tester
